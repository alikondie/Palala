# Palala
A board game in Javascript

This game relies on intelligence and luck, the goal is to set the maximum number of consecutive tokens in condition that
these tokens have different colors, so if you get 3 consecutive tokens you get 3 points, 4 points if 4, and you win the 
game if you set 5 consecutive colors.

You mustn't be drawn after getting too much points that might be against as the other player can get the five consecutive tokens
and win the game anyway.

Each player has 20 seconds to make a decision, the game is 8 minutes long.

1.To choose to play a random token in a empty case, click on 1 dé, the color that you have to play will be highlighted in orange.
2.To choose to permutate two random tokens, click on 2 dé, one color will be highlighted in orange and the other in light green.


Good luck, have fun!
